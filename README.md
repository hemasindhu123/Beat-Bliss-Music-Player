MUSIC-PLAYER-WITH-KARAOKE-FEATURE

**Beat Bliss** is a desktop music player app with built-in karaoke, letting users sing along and record vocals. It combines music playback, lyric display, and basic audio mixing in one smooth experience. Built with **ReactJS**, it offers a user-friendly interface, while **Node.js** and **Express.js** handle backend tasks like API requests and user sessions. **MongoDB** stores profiles, song data, and usage history.

Using **ElectronJS**, the app runs on desktop with access to system-level features like real-time mic input and audio routing. Lyrics are pulled from the **Genius API** and shown during playback (not time-synced), enhancing karaoke usability. The **Web Audio API** helps capture vocals and mix them with the music for playback.

Features like volume control let users adjust the background music, making vocals clearer. Beat Bliss offers a lightweight, offline karaoke experience—ideal for singers and music lovers—without needing third-party apps or internet platforms.
